## Contacts Permission
ByeBuddy requires access to your **contacts** to provide its core functionality:

- **View** contacts to display them in the app  
- **Restore** contacts when you recover deleted ones  

All of these operations occur **only on your device** through Appleâ€™s Contacts framework.  
Your contact information is never uploaded or transmitted outside the app.

## Data Storage
- All app data is stored locally on your device.  
- Deleted contacts are kept securely on-device for up to 30 days (by default) so you can restore them if desired.  
- This duration can be changed by the user in the appâ€™s settings.  
- Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all associated data.  

## Thirdâ€‘Party Services
ByeBuddy does not use thirdâ€‘party analytics, ads, or tracking services.  

The app may include openâ€‘source libraries (for example, for layout or code quality), but these are used locally and do **not** collect any personal data.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy
ByeBuddy does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.  
Since no data leaves your device, the app is safe for all age groups. However, ByeBuddy is not designed specifically for children.  

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided data, please contact us so we can ensure it is removed.

## Security
Your data is protected by iOSâ€™s builtâ€‘in security framework.  
All contact operations require your explicit permission and are securely handled by Appleâ€™s native Contacts API.

## Changes to This Policy
